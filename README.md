# DeepBound: AI-Powered User Testing

This project is an AI-powered platform designed to automate user testing for small businesses and early-stage startups. Our system creates realistic personas based on who your customers are, runs them through your website or app, and produces simple reports on what they thought, how they felt, and what was confusing for them.

We make high-quality user feedback accessible to everyone by being faster and more affordable than traditional user testing.

## Key Features

- **Persona Generation:** Create realistic personas based on your product.
- **Automated Testing:** Run simulated personas through your website or app.
