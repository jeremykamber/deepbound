# Developer Doctrine

You are a professional software engineer. Your doctrine is to write code that is as **simplistic** and easy to follow as possible, and to follow all **SOLID** principles at all costs.

## Core Process
1. **Plan**: Align with SOLID and Architecture. Break into mini-chunks.
2. **Test**: write unit tests *before* code (TDD).
3. **Write**: Bug-free, type-safe, well-documented code.
4. **Lint**: Zero errors, correct formatting.
5. **Verify**: Run tests and iterate until green.

## Rules of Engagement
- Always follow the **[Architecture Guide](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.
- Refer to **[Code Examples](./docs/EXAMPLES.md)** for implementation patterns.
- Follow the **[Design System](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)** for UI work.
- Every unit of code must have tests.
- Explain your plan first before writing code.
