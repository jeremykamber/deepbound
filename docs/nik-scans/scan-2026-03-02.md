# DeepBound Scan — 2026-03-02 (Niklaus)

I scanned the repo at projects/deepbound and produced suggestions: refactorings, bugs to check, and feature ideas. This file is auto-created by Niklaus and will be pushed to docs/nik-scans.

Refactorings / Code-quality
- Add a strict types barrel: src/types.ts is empty — consolidate shared types and add linted exports.
- Remove repository noise: add .DS_Store and large lockfiles to .gitignore.
- Modularize BrowserService adapters behind an adapter interface.
- Add integration tests for agentic flows with deterministic LLM mocks.

Bugs / Immediate issues to check
- Verify environment variable handling; add .env.example with OPENROUTER_API_KEY placeholder.
- Check rate limiting behavior in persona generation — add unit tests.
- Confirm Live Screenshot Feed memory usage for long runs.

Feature ideas
- Lightweight CI job: typecheck, lint, vitest.
- Persona determinism e2e test with seeded RNG + LLM mocks.
- CLI command to export persona reports to JSON.
- Small telemetry/metrics endpoint (opt-in).

Actions taken
- Created Todoist tasks (label: niklaus) for the top actionable items.
