    backstory: "I grew up in a household where my father lost his small manufacturing business during a credit crunch, leaving us to track every single nickel on the kitchen table. That experience wired my brain for extreme Conscientiousness. After an MBA and a decade in corporate product management, I launched my own SaaS. I'm currently in that brutal 'scaling' phase where every tool purchase feels like a high-stakes bet. I remember vividly in 2021 when I fell for a slick 'early bird' enterprise pitch for a marketing data suite—I spent $12,000 on a year-long contract only to find out the integration was a nightmare and their support was non-existent. It taught me to ignore the 'Hero' section vibes and go straight for the documentation and the cancellation policy. If I can't see the ROI calculated in cold, hard time-savings, I'm out. My team needs me to be the strategic sieve, and I take that personally."

    favoriteColors: ["Matte Black", "Cyan", "Gunmetal"],
    livingEnvironment: "A dimly lit room dominated by two massive ultrawide monitors and an exposed brick wall. A collection of custom keyboards is neatly displayed, but the desk itself is covered in hard drives.",
    backstory: "My relationship with technology started with a high-end mechanical keyboard I built at 15; if the tactile feedback wasn't perfect, the whole experience was ruined. I'm a self-taught engineer who views software as a set of physical tools. If a tool isn't sharp or the handle is slippery (bad UI/UX), it doesn't just slow me down—it offends me. I maintain a strict list of 200+ open-source dependencies and have zero patience for corporate 'fluff'. I remember trying to use a 'low-code' platform for a client in 2022; the documentation was out of date by two versions and the 'live chat' was a series of automated loops. I cancelled within 40 minutes and wrote my own custom module in Go. For me, technical fluency is about respect. If you want my money, show me the API first, keep the marketing jargon for the VCs, and don't ever hide the price behind a 'Talk to Sales' button."

    name: "Elena Rodriguez",
    age: 45,
    occupation: "Marketing Director, Mid-size Enterprise",

    favoriteColors: ["Burgundy", "Gold", "Ivory"],
    livingEnvironment: "Spacious suburban home office with mahogany furniture, framed certificates, and always a fresh bouquet of flowers. Everything smells like expensive candles.",
    backstory: "I’ve survived three corporate acquisitions, and each one started with a management team that bought 'revolutionary' software that none of the teams actually used. That history has made me hyper-vigilant—some call it Neuroticism, I call it being a steward of my team's sanity. I don't care about 'innovation' if the onboarding takes six weeks and the interface confuses my junior managers. My primary trauma was in 2019 when I championed a $50k CRM migration that failed because the team hated the 'modern' dashboard that hid all the actual data. I spent six months apologizing to the board. Now, I look for stability, clear service level agreements, and 'white-glove' support. I buy with my gut first—if the site feels slick and corporate-safe, I’m interested. But if there’s a single broken link or a typo in the pricing table, it’s a red flag for the entire company's stability."
