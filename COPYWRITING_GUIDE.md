This summary details the copywriting philosophy of Harry Dry (founder of *Marketing Examples*), as discussed in his conversation with David Perell. The core thesis is that copywriting is not about trickery or "fishbait"; it is the art of **simple communication**.

### I. The Three Rules of Effective Copywriting

To determine if copy is effective, Dry applies three specific tests to every sentence. If you get three "Nos," the copy is likely rubbish. If you get three "Yeses," you have a winner.

#### 1. Can I Visualize It? (Concrete vs. Abstract)

Human memory is visual. If a reader cannot picture what you are saying, they will not remember it. You must move from abstract concepts (intangible) to concrete objects (tangible).

* **The Memory Test:** In the interview, Dry lists six words: *Seamless transition, Charging pitbull, Muscly Irishman, Better way, Leg of lamb.*
* **Result:** People remember "Charging pitbull," "Muscly Irishman," and "Leg of lamb." They forget "Seamless transition" and "Better way."
* **Why:** You can feel a leg of lamb if you drop it on your foot. You cannot drop a "better way" on your foot.


* **The "Zoom In" Technique:** To fix abstract copy, write the abstract word at the top of a page and ask "What do I actually mean?" until you reach a physical image.
* *Example:* "Regain Fitness" (Abstract)  "Get off the couch"  "Run 5K."
* *Result:* **Couch to 5K** (The most successful fitness program name in history).



#### 2. Can I Falsify It? (Truth vs. Fluff)

Good copy makes a claim that can be proven true or false. Fluff (e.g., "innovative," "world-class") cannot be falsified and is therefore ignored by the brain.

* **The "No Talking, Only Pointing" Rule:** Imagine describing a single friend for a blind date.
* *Subjective (Bad):* "He has good values, he's funny, he's smart." (The date is skeptical).
* *Falsifiable (Good):* "He looks like Ryan Gosling, he is 6'2, he reads on the Tube." (These are objective facts).


* **Application:** Don't say "Gold is a great investment." Point to a graph of gold prices over 50 years.

#### 3. Can Nobody Else Say This? (Differentiation)

If a competitor can sign their name at the bottom of your ad, you have failed. Your copy must be unique to your product's specific reality.

* **Example (New Balance):** "Worn by supermodels in London and dads in Ohio."
* *Why it works:* Reebok cannot say this. Prada cannot say this. It is a fact exclusive to New Balance's brand identity.

### II. The "Who, What, How" Framework

Dry breaks down the creation of an ad or newsletter into three specific steps.

#### Step 1: Who are you talking to?

You must understand the context of the reader. Are they sitting in a boardroom, or are they walking past a sign while on vacation?

* **The Coffee Shop Example:** Two shops in a tourist town.
* *Shop A:* A massive menu listing 17 types of croissants and complex pricing.
* *Shop B:* A sign saying "Coffee and Pastry = £5."
* *Lesson:* Shop B wins because it speaks to the *tourist* who is walking by and just wants a quick snack without thinking.


* **The Snapchat Failure:** Snapchat spent **$7 million** on a Super Bowl ad. The average Super Bowl viewer is **39 years old**. A 39-year-old is generally not the target demographic for Snapchat. They failed to ask "Who are we talking to?"

#### Step 2: Have something to say (Substance)

You cannot write good copy if you don't have a strong opinion, belief, or value proposition.

* **Example (Hinge):** The brief was likely "A dating app for long-term relationships." The copy became **"The dating app designed to be deleted."**
* *The Substance:* It implies that other apps (Tinder) want to keep you swiping, whereas Hinge actually wants you to find love and leave.



#### Step 3: Say it well (Style & Rhythm)

This involves the technical craft: rhyme, rhythm, alliteration, and formatting.

* **The "One Mississippi" Test:** Show your ad to someone. If they don't understand it within two seconds ("One Mississippi, Two Mississippi"), the ad has failed. It must be instant.

### III. Case Studies in Great Detail

The interview analyzes several famous ads to illustrate these principles.

#### 1. The Economist

**Ad Copy:** *"I never read The Economist." — Management trainee, aged 42.*

* **Analysis:** This uses negative framing. It implies that if you *don't* read The Economist, you will be stuck as a trainee at age 42.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** It breaks the rules by having no logo and no image. The background color (Economist Red) *is* the brand.

#### 2. Apple iPod vs. The Competition

**Competitor Copy:** "4GB storage, plays MP3s."
**Apple Copy:** "1,000 songs in your pocket."

* **Analysis:** Apple used **Metonymy** (substituting a literal word for a related visual word). They replaced "Media Player" (literal) with "Pocket" (visual/concrete).
* **Statistic:** The text notes that **17 out of 20** American teenagers choose Apple. This dominance is attributed to selling the *image* rather than the *whiskey* (a quote by Ogilvy).

#### 3. Tesla Cybertruck

**Ad Copy:** *"Tougher than an F-150. Faster than a Porsche 911."*

* **Analysis:** The Cybertruck is a weird, confusing product. To make it understood, Tesla anchored it against two known entities.
* **Differentiation:** No other car in the world can make those two claims simultaneously.

#### 4. Corvette vs. Volvo

**Ad Copy:** *"They don't write songs about Volvos."*

* **Analysis:** Corvette acknowledges they aren't the safest or most practical, but they own the "romance" and "culture" of driving. It attacks the competitor (Volvo) by highlighting what the competitor *lacks* (soul).

### IV. The Writing Process: "Throw Money and Pray"

Harry Dry details the iterative process of creating a specific ad for his copywriting course. This demonstrates that great copy is **rewriting**, not writing.

1. **The Seed:** He saw a tweet stating: *"The difference between 1% and 2% conversion is not 1%, it is 100%."*
2. **The Conflict:** He drew a line down the middle of the page to create options.
* *Option A:* Spend twice as much on ads (The corporate way).
* *Option B:* Learn to write (The efficient way).


3. **Visual Inspiration:** He used the layout of an old Volkswagen "Winter Prep" ad as a template for structure.
*
4. **Refining the Header:** He iterated through dozens of headlines ("Go Fool Zuckerberg", "Spaghetti at War") before landing on **"Throw Money and Pray."**
5. **Design Integration:** He realized the list on the right was too long. He cut words until it fit the design. *Key Lesson:* You must write *inside* the design tool (Figma), not in a Google Doc.
6. **The Final Ad:**
* **Left (Bad):** "Throw Money and Pray." (Image of a stressed man).
* **Right (Good):** "Learn Copywriting." (Image of a lightbulb).

### V. Philosophy & Tactics

#### Facts > Adjectives

Adjectives (e.g., "fast," "world-class") are "wallpaper." Facts are "bricks."

* **The "Sports Announcer" Analogy:** A bad announcer says, "Tiger Woods looks sloppy." A good announcer says, "Tiger Woods usually hits 11 fairways; today he hit 7." Precision creates authority.
* **The Diamond Stat:** The ad slogan *"How can you make two months' salary last forever?"* by De Beers invented the standard for engagement rings. Today, **85%** of engagement rings are diamonds solely because of this campaign.

#### Kaplan’s Law of Words

* *"Any words that aren't working for you are working against you."*
* **The Paragraph Test:** If you can pull a sentence out of a paragraph and the paragraph still makes sense, that sentence **must** be deleted.

#### Experience is Essential

You cannot write great copy using AI alone because AI lacks **taste, conviction, and experience.**

* **David Ogilvy:** Wrote *"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."* He could only write that because he actually drove the car and noticed it.
* **Bukowski:** Worked as a postman for 20 years, then wrote *Post Office*.
* **Jack Kerouac:** Lived on the road for 7 years, then wrote *On the Road* in three weeks.

#### "High Quality Bar"

The secret to success is setting a high quality bar and never letting it drop, even when it is difficult. Dry mentions that for his newsletter, he writes an intro based on his immediate surroundings (e.g., "The tea is cold," "It is hailing outside") to ground the reader in reality, but he rewrites the educational content dozens of times until it is perfect.

### VI. Notable Statistics Mentioned

* **Apple Dominance:** 17 out of 20 American teenagers choose Apple iPhones.
* **Diamond Market:** 85% of engagement rings are diamonds (due to marketing).
* **Writing Volume:** A marketer will spend approximately **22,000 hours** of their career writing (4 hours a day × 300 days × 30 years). Dry uses this stat to sell his course: "Spend 22,000 hours writing, spend 2 hours learning to do it well."
* **Reading Speed:** One ad cited takes exactly **3.1 seconds** to read—the exact time it takes a Tesla Model S to go from 0–60 mph.
