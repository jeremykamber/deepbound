# AI Automated User Testing Platform

This project is an AI-powered platform designed to automate user testing for small businesses and early-stage startups. Our system generates realistic user personas based on your company's Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), runs these personas through your product or specific features end-to-end, and produces detailed reports on each AI agent’s thought processes, emotions, pain points, and actionable insights at every step.

We position ourselves as a faster, more affordable, and slightly lower-resolution alternative to traditional user testing—making high-quality UX feedback accessible to startups and small teams.

## Key Features

- **Persona Generation:** Create lifelike user personas from your ICP.
- **Automated Testing:** Run AI agents through your product or features.
- **Insightful Reporting:** Receive detailed feedback on agent experiences, including thoughts, emotions, pain points, and actionable recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand (state management)
- shadcn/ui (UI components)
- Hexagonal Architecture
